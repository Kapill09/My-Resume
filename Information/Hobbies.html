<h3>Welocme to my Hobbies Page</h3>
<p>Thanks for swinging by to peek into my hobbies. Let's Dive in !
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Photography/Videography:</b> It is not just a hobby for me—it's a journey of capturing moments and crafting stories through the lens. Each click is a new chapter in my visual storytelling adventure. </li>
        <li><b>Editing:</b> Tring to become the Picasso of pixels, transforming raw footage into cinematic ones. From color grading to seamless transitions, I love crafting videos</li>
        <li><b>Drawing:</b> I enjoy doodling and sketching, creating art that sometimes resembles recognizable figures (well, most of the time).I love to draw, especially when I find myself overthinking </li>    
        <li> <b>Basketball:</b> Basketball: On weekends, I'm out on the court, perfecting my three-pointer and dreaming of dunking like Jordan (or at least making a layup without looking like I'm breakdancing).</li>
